## 1. Project Planning.
I have created a wireframe of a model I would like to create. Its intuitive for the user and the focus is on the products we sell. What I want to do differently from the Boutique Ado project where there is eyecatching designs to promote user interactions, I would like to focus on the products colors(which they are) to try and make them look good and eye-catching.<br>
There is no way bombarding the page with fancy colors and flashy designs when the product I'd sell is actual colors. And there is a need for the products to be seen clearly and not polluted by background colors and/or things that might disturb the view.<br>
While at the same time I want the page to be interesting and not look like a Windows98 interface, I think this is a case of spartan designs and a easy-on-the-eyes color palette. 

>> User Goals:
The user goals are quite self explanitary, a potential customer lands on the page looking for color, perhaps they are painting a fence, a baby chamber, or just like graffiti, who am I to judge. The user will be able to use a search function to find different colors. searching for "red", would bring up all colors with the word red in it (e.g "Sunset Red", "Coca Cola Red", "Tomato Red"). And the same for any other color. 

>> Owner Goals:
The goal for me as the company/page owner, would be to offer a reliable customer service where I sell paint to paying customers, sorting payments and shipping. To create the easiest and most trustworthy experience for the customer.
