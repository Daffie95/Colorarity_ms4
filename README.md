# Colorarity

Colorarity is a companypage that acts as a wholesale for paint. With fast worldwide delivery and a high variety of colors in spray cans and buckets. This is a project that acts like the Milestone project 4, which is the 
last project in the full stack course hosted by Code Institute. This project focuses on using full stack frameworks, and in this case I will be using Django.

## 1. Project Planning.
I have created a wireframe of a model I would like to create. Its intuitive for the user and the focus is on the products we sell. What I want to do differently from the Boutique Ado project where there is eyecatching designs to promote user interactions, I would like to focus on the products colors(which they are) to try and make them look good and eye-catching.<br>
There is no way bombarding the page with fancy colors and flashy designs when the product I'd sell is actual colors. And there is a need for the products to be seen clearly and not polluted by background colors and/or things that might disturb the view.<br>
While at the same time I want the page to be interesting and not look like a Windows98 interface, I think this is a case of spartan designs and a easy-on-the-eyes color palette. 

>> User Goals:
The user goals are quite self explanitary, a potential customer lands on the page looking for color, perhaps they are painting a fence, a baby chamber, or just like graffiti, who am I to judge. The user will be able to use a search function to find different colors. searching for "red", would bring up all colors with the word red in it (e.g "Sunset Red", "Coca Cola Red", "Tomato Red"). And the same for any other color. 

>> Owner Goals:
The goal for me as the company/page owner, would be to offer a reliable customer service where I sell paint to paying customers, sorting payments and shipping. To create the easiest and most trustworthy experience for the customer.

## 4. Bugs & Errors.
> ~~While working on creating the navigation, I could not get my current bootstrap/JS to actually display the dropdown menu on the page, the link worked but no dropdown would show.
I went trough Slack and found similar issues that all reverted back to the source code for the Boutique Ado project.~~ I went and tried the same thing and changing the JS script CDNs 
made it work. 
<br>
<br>
> ~~The Products does render the correct template but the injected content is not displayed on screen.~~<br>
a break in the logo caused layering issues.
## 5. Additional Comments.
> having to end working early (21-04-04) due to scheduled power outage in my appartment complex.  
## 6. External Resources.
> Django allAuth<br>
> bootstrap<br>
> Google Fonts<BR>
> Font awesome<br>
>> A lot of code used in this project is revamped code from the previous Boutique Ado project, because I feel like there is not really a better way to implement the same code, but in a different way.
>> The Boutique Ado project suffers greatly from the lack of explanitary measures of WHY and HOW functions work the way they do, knowing what does this and that is great, but the learning outcomes are very slim
>> and without extensively going trough Django documentation, there really isnt a whole lot to take away from it.
